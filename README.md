Place this file in `Stand/Lua Scripts` and start it.   vscript will automatically update itself, but you can force an update with the update option at the bottom of the options list.

**Important:** if you want the drift scoring to work correctly you *must* set the refresh rate option to your monitor's frame rate (or the frame rate at which your game runs if you run it at e.g. half your monitor's refresh rate).
